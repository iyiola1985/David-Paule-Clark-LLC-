            His name is on the company, and that is deliberate. It reflects a level
            of personal responsibility: the drawings, the coordination, the work
            on site, and the finished spaces ultimately answer back to his
            commitment to integrity.

            David’s approach to construction leadership is intentionally steady.
            Clients do not need noise—they need someone who knows how to carry a
            project from idea to completion without losing control of the details.
          </p>
          <p class="muted">
            That means being on site when key decisions are made, asking hard
            questions about quality, and setting expectations that are firm but fair
            for every trade and partner involved. The result is a company that
            operates like a well‑run business, not just a jobsite.

          <h3>Integrity in every commitment.</h3>
          <p>
            When David gives his word—on scope, schedule, or quality—he treats
            that commitment as a contract with himself first. The intention is to
            ensure that clients are never surprised by how the work is handled.

        <article class="value-card">
          <h3>Respect for the investment.</h3>
          <p>
            Construction is one of the largest, most visible investments many
            clients will make. David’s leadership reflects that reality with
            professional reporting, organized documentation, and clear next steps.

        <article class="value-card">
          <h3>Hands‑on, not distant.</h3>
          <p>
            Rather than delegating away all responsibility, David remains an
            active presence. Clients know who is accountable and who they are
            ultimately partnering with: the owner himself.

            David’s career in construction has been built in layers: first
            understanding the work hands‑on, then coordinating teams, then
            directing projects at a level where every decision carries weight.
          </p>
          <p>
            That progression gives him a rare view of a project. He knows how a
            design decision will play out on site, how a schedule decision will
            impact a subcontractor, and how a detail—or the lack of one—will feel
            years after the project is complete.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today, as CEO of David Paule Clark LLC, he leads with that context in
            mind, aligning the interests of the client, the project team, and the
            long‑term performance of the building itself.
